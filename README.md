# README

## Public Ethereum Accounts (for NFT certification):

mainnet: 0x688625577399Bca4AdEb8e3574195A89D7ad65E2
rinkeby: 0x7Ed65bf3e8fABCd88347abB4B6aE470ADB909123

## Prioject description

The idea behind the dapp is that it would be part of a zombie apocalypse survival game. Using this dapp players are able to mint an NFT that represents their survival kit.
A survival kit consists of a randomly generated combination of:

- A weapon
- A vehicle
- An item

The NFTs are fully on-chain.
After connecting their metamask wallet the UI will tell the player how many survival kits (NFTs) are remaining on the contract and give them the option to mint one.

## Directory Structure

The root directory of the project contains the following sub-directories:

- client: contains all the frontend code, including all dependencies and configuration.
- contracts: contains all the solidity code. Also contains another sub-directory called "libraries" which holds a Base64.sol library.
- coverage: contains all the file related to the solidity-coverage plugin.
- migrations: contains the migration scripts for deploying solidity contracts to the blockchain.
- node_modules: contains all smart contract dependencies
- scripts: contains the 'start_ganache_cli.sh' script for starting up a local development blockchain. (Required to run unit tests)
- tests - contains the smart contract unit tests (written in javascript). Also includes a utils sub-directory.

## Accessing the UI:

The frontend has already been deployed on Netlify and canm be accessed here:
https://618c0f1bea88700007f11808--silly-poincare-c82224.netlify.app/#/

## How to spin up the dapp locally:

To start the dapp locally requires two spearate tasks:

- Starting the frontend
- Deploying the smart contract to either a development blockchain or a testnet such as Rinkeby.

### Starting the frontend

Navigate to the `client` directory:

```
cd client
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start the application

```
npm run start
```

In the browser, visit:

localhost:3000

## Deploying the smart contract

In a new terminal, navigate to the project root and install the projects dependencies

```
npm install
```

Also install ganache-cli

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

### Deploying to a local dev network

Start a local development blockchain on port 8545 by running:

```
gananche_cli
```

Deploy the contract

```
truffle migrate --network development --reset
```

**Important:** After redeploying you will need to add the new address of SurvivalKitClaim contract and to AppContext.js (line 12)

### Deploying to the rinkeby testnet

Create a .env file in the projects root directory and add the following:

- Your metamask seed
- Infura URL including API key.

Example:

```
MNEMONIC="This is not a real seed phrase as that would be silly"
INFURA_URL="https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/a87687a687ddgy8686sss"
```

Then deploy the contract

```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset
```

**Important:** After redeploying you will need to add the new address of SurvivalKitClaim contract and to AppContext.js (line 12)

## Running the test suite

If not done already, start a local development blockchain on port 8545 by running:

```
ganache-cli -p 8545
```

Note: sudo is required to run the script because it needs permission to create the log file (/var/log/ganache.log).

To run the test suite simple enter the following command:

```
truffle test
```

To generate a test coverage report run the following command:

```
truffle run coverage
```

## Extra functionality to add if there is time.

- Automate the retrieval of the contract address from the generated JSON file, instead of having to manually copy and paste it after a new deployment.
- Maybe experiment with making the contract upgradable via a proxy
