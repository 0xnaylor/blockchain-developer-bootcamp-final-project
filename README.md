After downloading the repo run `npm install`

Create a .env file in the projects root directory and add the following:

- Your metamask seed
- Infura URL including API key.

TODO:

- Cannot connect metamask to frontend when running the backend on Ganache.
- Automate the retrieval of the contract address from the generated JSON file, instead of having to manually copy and paste it after a new deployment.
